I believe you may be referring to "Markdown" rather than "Markdon." If that's the case, here's some information about Markdown:

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004. It's designed to be easy to read, write, and convert to HTML. Some key points about Markdown include:

1. Simplicity: It uses simple and intuitive syntax for formatting text.

2. Readability: Markdown files are easily readable even in their raw form.

3. Versatility: It can be converted to many formats, including HTML, PDF, and others.

4. Wide adoption: It's used in many platforms like GitHub, Reddit, and Stack Overflow.

5. Common uses: Documentation, readme files, forum posts, and simple web content.

6. Syntax: Uses symbols like asterisks for bold/italic, hashes for headers, and brackets/parentheses for links.

7. Variants: There are several flavors of Markdown, including CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown.

8. File extension: Typically .md or .markdown

Markdown is popular among writers, developers, and content creators for its simplicity and efficiency in creating formatted text without the complexity of full HTML.

If you meant something else by "markdon," please clarify, and I'll be happy to provide information on that instead.
